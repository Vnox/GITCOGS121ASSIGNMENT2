1. Visibility and simplicity: For the first page, we emphasized visibility. We uses giant sized title to tell the user what this web app is a bout, and we only uses one button, which will easily capture the user's attention and then help the user to log in to his or her instagram account. 

2. Feedback: After logging in to the user's instagram account, we have a clear feedback to the user telling them that the loging in has succeeded with their username, which makes the user feel more confirmed.
